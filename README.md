# OC-Reactor-Control-Script
A Reactor Control script used in conjunction with OpenComputers and Draconic Evolution Reactors

NOTE! This script was only tested under Minecraft 1.7.10 and at current state it is unknown if it works in newer versions.
It is also possible to replace Project: Blue panels with Industrial wires' panels in 1.12 and above, however such behaviour was not tested

Please refer to the wiring diagram included with this repository to configure the panels correctly.

This script is still a work in progress, so expect it not to work fully. This readme is also vague when it comes to setup
